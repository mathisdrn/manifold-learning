Global vs. Local
: Global are methods that try to preserve the overall structure of the data, while local methods focus on preserving relationships within local neighborhoods.

| Algorithm                     | Approach                                    | Goal                                                                   | Strengths                                                                               | Weaknesses                                                                                                     | Computational Cost | Global/Local |

| **MDS (Multi-dimensional Scaling)** | Preserving pairwise distances             | Embed data points in a lower dimension while preserving distances      | Works well when pairwise distances are meaningful, classic method                                  | Computationally expensive for large datasets, sensitive to noise in distance measurements, global optimization can be hard | High               | Global       |
| **IsoMap**                   | Geodesic distance on neighborhood graph      | Preserve global geodesic distances                                       | Robust to outliers, captures global structure well                                       | Sensitive to "shortcuts" in graph construction, computationally expensive for large datasets                  | High               | Global       |
| **Locally Linear Embedding** | Local linear reconstruction of points       | Preserve local linear relationships                                   | Computationally efficient, good for locally smooth manifolds                               | Sensitive to noise, can have issues with non-convex manifolds, requires careful neighborhood selection           | Medium             | Local        |
| **MLLE (Modified LLE)**       | Multiple local linear reconstructions        | Improve robustness of LLE to noise and sampling density variations     | More robust to noise and sampling variations than LLE                                   | More computationally expensive than LLE, still sensitive to neighborhood selection                               | Medium-High        | Local        |
| **HLLE (Hessian Eigenmapping)** | Hessian of the manifold                     | Capture local curvature information                                    | Less sensitive to parameter tuning than LLE variants, can handle some non-convexities | Computationally expensive, can be sensitive to noise                                                              | High               | Local        |
| **LTSA (Local Tangent Space Alignment)** | Aligning local tangent spaces              | Preserve local geometry by aligning tangent spaces                      | Robust to noise, can handle some non-convexities                                        | Computationally more expensive than LLE, requires careful parameter tuning                                     | Medium-High        | Local        |
| **Spectral Embedding (Laplacian Eigenmaps)** | Graph Laplacian Eigenvectors              | Preserve local neighborhood relationships (similar to LLE in spirit) | Computationally efficient, widely applicable                                            | Sensitive to noise, can have issues with disconnected graphs                                                    | Medium             | Local        |
| **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** | Probabilistic similarity based on t-distribution | Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D                               | Excellent for visualization, reveals clusters well                                       | Computationally intensive, sensitive to parameter tuning (perplexity), global structure is not well preserved, can create misleading "clusters" | High               | Primarily Local, with some global tendencies |
