    "### Main Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "IsoMap transforms the original high-dimensional data by attempting to preserve geodesic distances between points rather than Euclidean distances. \n",

    "Euclidean vs. Geodesic distance\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The geodesic distance is approximated by finding the shortest path between points along a neighborhood graph. After applying IsoMap, data points receive new coordinates in a lower-dimensional space where the Euclidean distances between points approximate the original geodesic distances. This helps to \"unfold\" nonlinear manifolds - imagine straightening out a rolled-up piece of paper while preserving the distances along its surface.\n",

    "### Theoretical Aspect\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization problem in IsoMap can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{Y} \\sum_{i,j} (D_G(i,j) - ||y_i - y_j||)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $D_G(i,j)$ is the geodesic distance between points i and j in the original space\n",
    "- $y_i$ and $y_j$ are the coordinates of points i and j in the new low-dimensional space\n",
    "- $||y_i - y_j||$ is the Euclidean distance between points in the new space\n",
    "\n",
    "The key variables being optimized are the coordinates Y of all points in the lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "IsoMap follows these main steps:\n",
    "1. Construct neighborhood graph by connecting each point to its k nearest neighbors or all points within Îµ distance\n",
    "2. Compute geodesic distances between all pairs of points using Floyd-Warshall or Dijkstra's algorithm\n",
    "3. Apply Classical MDS to the geodesic distance matrix:\n",
    "   - Center the distance matrix\n",
    "   - Compute eigendecomposition of the centered matrix\n",
    "   - Project onto top eigenvectors to get final coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution leverages the fact that Classical MDS has a closed-form solution through eigendecomposition, making it computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "The IsoMap solution has interesting optimality properties:\n",
    "- The eigendecomposition step provides a globally optimal solution to the MDS step\n",
    "- However, the overall method is not guaranteed to find a global optimum of the true manifold learning problem because:\n",
    "  1. The neighborhood graph construction is a discrete approximation\n",
    "  2. The geodesic distance estimation depends on the graph structure and may not perfectly capture the true manifold distances\n",
    "  3. The method assumes the manifold is isometric to a convex subset of Euclidean space\n",
    "\n",
    "Key limitations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitivity to the choice of neighborhood size/radius\n",
    "- Potential \"short-circuiting\" if the neighborhood graph connects distant parts of the manifold\n",
    "- Poor performance when the manifold is not approximately isometric to a convex subset of Euclidean space\n",
    "- Computational complexity of $O(n^3)$ for n data points, making it challenging for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, IsoMap often performs well in practice when its assumptions are reasonably satisfied and has become a fundamental algorithm in the manifold learning toolkit."
